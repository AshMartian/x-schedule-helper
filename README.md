Remembers the previously selected date on 𝕏 for post scheduling and adds dropdown incrementing buttons.
This is really helpful for mass scheduling regular content on 𝕏, save yourself hundreds of clicks!

Each time a select input is changed, the extension saves the value to Chrome's local storage. When a value is loaded upon entering the schedule modal, the select input is outlined in green.

When a select input is modified by the increment buttons, it is outlined in purple. 

Works on x.com and pro.x.com, however it works best for 𝕏 Pro when going straight to this url first: https://pro.x.com/compose/post/schedule (or reloading the page after clicking schedule).
